    <h1>Modern Web App Development</h1>
    <p>
      Modern web app development focuses on creating fast, secure, and
      user-friendly applications using the latest technologies and best
      practices. Below are some important points to understand the process.
    </p>

    <h1 class="bg1">1. Component-Based Architecture</h1>
    <p>
      Modern web apps use component-based structures, where each part of the
      interface is built as a reusable component. This makes development faster
      and easier to maintain.
    </p>

    <h1 class="bg2">2. Responsive Design</h1>
    <p>
      Responsive design ensures that a web app looks good and functions properly
      on all devices â€” desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. HTML5 and CSS3 help
      achieve this easily.
    </p>

    <h1 class="bg3">3. Performance Optimization</h1>
    <p>
      Techniques like lazy loading, code splitting, and caching help improve
      loading speed and overall performance of web applications.
    </p>

    <h1 class="bg4">4. API Integration</h1>
    <p>
      Modern apps connect to APIs for data exchange. RESTful and GraphQL APIs
      are popular choices to make applications more dynamic and data-driven.
    </p>

    <h1 class="bg5">5. Security Best Practices</h1>
    <p>
      Implementing HTTPS, validating user input, and using secure authentication
      methods helps protect apps and users from security threats.
    </p>

    <h1 class="bg6">6. User Experience (UX)</h1>
    <p>
      Modern web apps prioritize clear design, fast interactions, and
      accessibility to ensure a smooth experience for all users.
